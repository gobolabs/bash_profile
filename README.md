# Bash profile file 

Bash profile file for development and system administration

Personally oriented, it considers that you are using a Mac for some commands.

If it useful, that's great ! If it isn't, it's a backup.

# Note for Mac os Catalina

Zsh is now used. I will update this file asap...

So, maybe next year...
